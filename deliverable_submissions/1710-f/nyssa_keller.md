# Module 2 Professional Development:

##  Written reflection:

### How you've used agile as a process at Turing and what kind of project management tools you utilized. Address these questions: 

* What were you already doing? 

    In my past projects I have been utilzing project management tools like Waffle.

* What did you put into place in Module Two?

    During Mod2, I have been going back to refactor my work to make the code cleaner.

* What was effective?

    This has been effective in making my code easier to read.

* What do you want to improve on in future projects?

    In the future, I would like to be more organized by using Waffle more efficiently.

* Description of the role you played in your pair/group projects this module -- what was your role as a teammate? How did you utilize * your strengths and leadership skills?

    During my group project with Melissa, she let me take the lead on the project, so I was able to organize the way we did       things.

## Feedback II reflection:
 
	Melissa and I had our feedback conversation on December 6, 2017. Neither of us had a chance to prepare for the feedback conversation because we had a conflict come up that needed to be addressed before we had the feedback class. I felt like the conversation went well overall.
    I was upset with Melissa because she completed a major part of the project without consulting with me first. She could tell I was upset so she wanted to address the problem head on so that we would not have a hard time finishing our project. I do not feel comfortable during confrontations. I tend to get very anxious and freeze up.  It was difficult for me to push pass this in our conversation. However, I think Melissa could pick up on this so she lead the conversation in a way that helped me feel more comfortable expressing my frustrations.
    During this conversation, I had to make sure that I was still showing appreciation of the work Melissa did. She explained to me that she did not intend to leave me out of this decision she just did not want to bother me when she knew I was at a family event. She was trying to be helpful and did not think that I was being appreciative of that. It put her at ease to know that I appreciated her trying to be helpful. I think our relationship was strengthened after her and I had this conversation. 


## Working draft of professional story (1-2 paragraphs)

	Growing up with two brothers, I became very competitive. My competitiveness drove me to exceed at school and to always push myself to be my best. After I graduated high school, I attended the University of Colorado Denver. During my first two years at school, I wasn’t sure about what I wanted to major in. So I settled for taking general education classes. 
    While I was attending the university, I also had a part time job at Charming Charlie. I started out as just a sales associate, however, my competitive nature made me want to move up. A year after working there, I was promoted to a manager. This was life changing for me. I found that I love to manage people. I used my competitiveness to help drive my team to be the best that we could be. Our team was surpassing sales from the previous year and our store visuals improved immensely. Although I enjoyed my job, I knew retail wasn’t my plan for the long run. 
    Toward the end of my sophomore year, I was worried because I still didn’t know what I wanted to major in. I felt like I was wasting time and money by aimlessing attending classes that I had no interest in. I turned to my dad, who has been a developer for a long time. He told me that I should consider becoming a developer because I’m analytical and like solving puzzles. I did some research on Turing and decided that I wanted to attend. I liked the hands-on nature of the school and how quick the program is. I decided to drop out of the university and quit my job so I could enroll at Turing and become a developer.

## Plan for outreach & networking as you go into Module 3 

### Meetups/Networking Events: Identify 1 meetup and/or other networking event that you'll attend between now and the end of Module 3. Answer these questions:

* Why will you attend this particular event?

    I want to attend a meet up by DTC Web & Mobile Development Group because they are near my house and because I am               interested in mobile development.

* Who do you hope to connect with at this event?

    I hope to connect with some experienced developers to learn more about the industry.

* How will you follow-up with the people you connect at this event?

    I will email the people I meet at the event to see if we can personally meetup again.
    
### Warm Outreach: Identify a mentor, alum, or someone else in the Turing community you will reach out to by the end of Module  If * * you have someone you'd like to reach out to outside of the Turing community, go for it! Describe:

I want to connect with Karina Gonzalez. I want to connect with her because I was told by one of my cohort mates that her and I would be a good match because of our similar personalities. I will contact her by the beginning of Mod3 and see if she would like to meet for coffee. My follow up will thank her for meeting with me and thanking her for her insite.
